Implements : Bidirectional search that is guaranteed to meet in the middle : [link](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/10436/10295)

We develop both the MM algorithm as well as its non-heuristic variant MM0. We implement it for two problem,
i) The Position Search - To find the path from the start location to the location of the single food pellet in the pacman maze.
ii) The Corner Search - To find the path to eat 4 food pellets spread across the 4 corners of the pacman maze.

Instructions to run : 

## 1) Position Search Problem : 

```python pacman.py -l MAZE_NAME -p SearchAgent -a fn=mm,heuristic=HEURISTIC_NAME```

Replace MAZE_NAME with 1 amongst the 6 mazes we have created:

1. tinyMaze
2. smallMaze
3. mediumMaze
4. contoursMaze
5. customMaze
6. openMaze

In order to run MM0: Replace HEURISTIC_NAME with nullHeuristic

In order to run MM with Manhattan Heuristic: Replace HEURISTIC_NAME with manhattanHeuristic

In order to run MM with any other Heuristic: Define the heuristic function in search.py, and replace HEURISTIC_NAME with the function name



## 2) Corner Search Problem : 

```python pacman.py -l MAZE_NAME -p SearchAgent -a fn=mm_corner,prob=CornersProblem```

Replace MAZE_NAME with 1 amongst the 6 mazes we have created : 

1. tinyCorners
2. mediumCorners
3. bigCorners
4. customTinyCorners
5. customMediumCorners
6. customBigCorners

The above code will run by default with a heuristic. To run MM0, uncomment these two lines : [1](https://github.com/walstanb/bidirectional-search/blob/main/search/search.py#L556) and [2](https://github.com/walstanb/bidirectional-search/blob/main/search/search.py#L656), and run the code again.
